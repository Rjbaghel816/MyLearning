* **Code Documentation**: Comments and explanations inside the source code.
* **SDK Documentation**: Guides for developers using a software development kit.
* **System Architecture**: Diagrams and descriptions of system design.

### 3. Process Documentation

* **SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures)**: Defines standard workflows for teams.
* **DevOps Documentation**: CI/CD pipeline, deployment guides.
* **Project Roadmaps**: Future development plans for a project.

### 4. Internal Team Documentation

* **Meeting Notes**: Key discussions and decisions made in meetings.
* **Onboarding Guides**: Helps new team members understand the project.
* **Incident Reports**: Logs of system failures and resolutions.

## Best Practices for Writing Technical Documentation

### 4. Include Visuals
Diagrams, screenshots, and code snippets improve understanding.

### 5. Use Markdown (.md) or Documentation Tools
Popular tools include:

* Markdown (README.md for GitHub)
* Docusaurus (for structured documentation)
* Swagger (for API documentation)
* Sphinx (for Python projects)

### 6. Keep It Up to Date
Regularly update documentation with new changes.
